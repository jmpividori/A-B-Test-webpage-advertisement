Market research showed that using animal icons on the purchase page of www.catsVSdogs.com might promote a higher conversion rate, i.e. better sales.

In this work, the data will be tested, by performing EDA and A/B statistical test in order to know if this statement is true.

The questions we ask to develop the A/B Test are:

✅ Was the experiment conducted properly?.

✅ Does the gathered information meet high-quality standards?.

✅ Is there statistical evidence supporting the selection of one group over the other in terms of achieving the conversion rate objective?.
